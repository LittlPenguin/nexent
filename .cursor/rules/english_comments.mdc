# English-only Comments

- All comments and docstrings must be written in clear, concise English.
- Do not use non-English characters in comments (string literals may contain any language).
- Use proper grammar and spelling; avoid ambiguous abbreviations.

## Do
```python
# Initialize cache for 60 seconds
self.cache_ttl = 60
```

## Don't
```python
# 初始化缓存 60 秒 - FORBIDDEN
# データキャッシュ60秒 - FORBIDDEN
# 데이터 캐시 60초 - FORBIDDEN
```

## Scope
- Docstrings, inline comments, TODO/FIXME/NOTE, header comments
- Configuration comments in YAML/JSON and other config files

## Validation Checklist
- All comments are in English
- Docstrings use proper English grammar
- No non-Latin characters in comments (except inside strings)
- Comments are clear and provide value

## Optional Automation
- Pre-commit hook to detect non-English comments
- IDE extensions for real-time detection
- CI checks for compliance
