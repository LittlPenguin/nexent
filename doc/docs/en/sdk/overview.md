# Nexent SDK

Nexent is a powerful, enterprise-grade Agent SDK that revolutionizes intelligent agent development. Built on proven enterprise architecture, it provides a comprehensive solution for building production-ready AI agents with distributed processing, real-time streaming, multi-modal capabilities, and an extensive ecosystem of tools and models.

## üöÄ Installation

### User Installation
If you want to use nexent:

```bash
# Install using uv (recommended)
uv add nexent

# Or install from source
uv pip install .
```

### Development Environment Setup
If you are a third-party SDK developer:

```bash
# Method 1: Install dependencies only (without nexent)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Method 2: Install complete development environment (including nexent)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Includes all development tools (testing, code quality checks, etc.)
```

The development environment includes the following additional features:
- Code quality checking tools (ruff)
- Testing framework (pytest)
- Data processing dependencies (unstructured)
- Other development dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components

### ü§ñ NexentAgent - Enterprise-grade Agent Framework

The core of nexent is the `NexentAgent` and `CoreAgent` classes, providing complete intelligent agent solutions:

- **Multi-model Support**: Support for OpenAI, vision language models, long context models, etc.
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with Model Context Protocol tool ecosystem
- **Dynamic Tool Loading**: Support for dynamic creation and management of local and MCP tools
- **Distributed Execution**: High-performance execution engine based on thread pools and asynchronous architecture
- **State Management**: Comprehensive task state tracking and error recovery mechanisms

### ‚öôÔ∏è CoreAgent - Code Execution Engine

Inherits and enhances SmolAgent's `CodeAgent`, providing the following key capabilities:

- **Python Code Execution**: Support for parsing and executing Python code, capable of dynamic task processing
- **Multi-language Support**: Built-in Chinese and English prompt templates, switchable as needed
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time streaming display of model output through MessageObserver
- **Step Tracking**: Record and display each step of Agent execution for debugging and monitoring
- **Interrupt Control**: Support for task interruption and graceful stop mechanisms
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms to improve stability
- **State Management**: Maintain and pass execution state, supporting continuous processing of complex tasks

CoreAgent implements the ReAct framework's think-act-observe loop:
1. **Think**: Use large language models to generate solution code
2. **Act**: Execute the generated Python code
3. **Observe**: Collect execution results and logs
4. **Repeat**: Continue thinking and executing based on observation results until the task is completed

### üì° MessageObserver - Streaming Message Processing

Core implementation of the message observer pattern, used to handle Agent's streaming output:

- **Streaming Output Capture**: Real-time capture of tokens generated by the model
- **Process Type Distinction**: Format output according to different processing stages (model output, code parsing, execution logs, etc.)
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for Chinese and English output formats
- **Unified Interface**: Provide unified processing methods for messages from different sources

ProcessType enumeration defines the following processing stages:
- `STEP_COUNT`: Current execution step
- `MODEL_OUTPUT_THINKING`: Model thinking process output
- `MODEL_OUTPUT_CODE`: Model code generation output
- `PARSE`: Code parsing results
- `EXECUTION_LOGS`: Code execution results
- `AGENT_NEW_RUN`: Agent basic information
- `FINAL_ANSWER`: Final summary results
- `SEARCH_CONTENT`: Search result content
- `PICTURE_WEB`: Web image processing results
