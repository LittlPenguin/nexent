## 🚫 Common Errors & Operations

### 🌐 Network Connection Issues
- **Q: How can a Docker container access models deployed on the host machine (e.g., Ollama)?**
  - A: Since `localhost` inside the container refers to the container itself, use one of these methods to connect to host services:

    **Option 1: Use Docker's special DNS name `host.docker.internal`**  
    Supported environments: Mac/Windows and newer Docker Desktop versions (Linux version also supported)  
    ```bash
    http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
    ```

    **Option 2: Use host machine's actual IP (ensure firewall allows access)**
    ```bash
    http://[HOST_IP]:11434/v1
    ```

    **Option 3: Modify Docker Compose configuration**  
    Add to your docker-compose.yaml file:
    ```yaml
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    ```

### 🔌 Port Conflicts
- **Q: Port 3000 is already in use. How can I change it?**
  - A: You can modify the port in the Docker Compose configuration file.

### 📦 Container Issues
- **Q: How do I check container logs?**
  - A: Use `docker logs <container_name>` to view logs for specific containers.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### 🔢 Model Connection Issues

- **Q: Why can't my model connect?**
  - A: Check the following:
    1. **Correct API endpoint**: Ensure you're using the right base URL
    2. **Valid API key**: Verify your API key has proper permissions
    3. **Model name**: Confirm the model identifier is correct
    4. **Network access**: Ensure your deployment can reach the provider's servers
    
    For model setup instruction, see [Model Configuration](../user-guide/model-configuration) in User Guide.
